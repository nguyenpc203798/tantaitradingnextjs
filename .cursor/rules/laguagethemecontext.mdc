Attention to Language Context in English UI Modifications

## Always Check Language Context:

Before modifying or updating any English-language UI text, ensure that you clearly understand the Language Context. Confirm the meaning, tone, and intention of the existing content.

## Maintain Consistency:

All UI text changes should align with the established terminology, style, and voice outlined in the Language Context documentation.

## Update Language Context Upon Changes:

Immediately update the Language Context documentation whenever you introduce or alter UI text. Clearly document what was changed, why, and any implications for translators or future developers.

## Review Language Context Periodically:

Regularly review the Language Context documentation to ensure it accurately reflects current UI elements, language guidelines, and user interaction flows.

## Validation and Approval:

All UI modifications involving textual changes must be validated against the Language Context and approved by a supervisor or language specialist to prevent context-related errors.




Following this rule helps ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency in English-language user interfaces, improving overall user experience and minimizing errors during localization.
